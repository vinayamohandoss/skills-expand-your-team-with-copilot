# Trigger Recursion Prevention Solution

## Overview

This solution addresses the trigger recursion issue shown in the `error.log` file where "maximum trigger depth exceeded" errors were occurring between Opportunity, OpportunityContactRole, and Contract triggers.

## Problem Analysis

From the error log (`error.log`), the issue was:
```
System.DmlException: Insert failed. First exception on row 0; first error: CANNOT_INSERT_UPDATE_ACTIVATE_ENTITY, OpportunityContactRoleTrigger: maximum trigger depth exceeded
Contract trigger event AfterUpdate
OpportunityContactRole trigger event AfterInsert
Opportunity trigger event AfterUpdate
OpportunityContactRole trigger event AfterUpdate
Opportunity trigger event AfterUpdate
...
```

This shows a circular pattern where:
1. Contract trigger updates Opportunity
2. Opportunity trigger creates/updates OpportunityContactRole
3. OpportunityContactRole trigger updates Opportunity
4. This cycle repeats until Salesforce's trigger depth limit is exceeded

## Solution Components

### 1. TriggerRecursionHelper.cls
A utility class that provides:
- **Execution tracking**: Tracks which triggers have run in the current transaction
- **Recursion depth monitoring**: Prevents operations from exceeding a safe recursion limit (3 levels)
- **Operation-specific tracking**: Different operations can have separate recursion limits

Key Methods:
- `hasAlreadyRun(String triggerName)`: Check if trigger already executed
- `isRecursionExceeded(String operationName)`: Check if recursion limit exceeded
- `incrementRecursionDepth(String operationName)`: Track operation depth
- `decrementRecursionDepth(String operationName)`: Cleanup operation depth

### 2. OpportunityTrigger.trigger
Handles all Opportunity trigger events with recursion prevention:
- Uses TriggerRecursionHelper to prevent infinite loops
- Delegates business logic to OpportunityTriggerHandler
- Implements try/finally pattern to ensure cleanup

### 3. OpportunityTriggerHandler.cls
Business logic for Opportunity operations:
- **Validation**: Ensures data quality (name required, close date not in past)
- **Contact Role Management**: Creates default contact roles for new opportunities
- **Stage-based Updates**: Updates contact roles based on opportunity stage changes
- **Recursion Prevention**: Checks recursion limits before performing DML operations

### 4. OpportunityContactRoleTrigger.trigger
Handles all OpportunityContactRole trigger events with recursion prevention:
- Uses TriggerRecursionHelper to prevent infinite loops
- Delegates business logic to OpportunityContactRoleTriggerHandler
- Implements try/finally pattern to ensure cleanup

### 5. OpportunityContactRoleTriggerHandler.cls
Business logic for OpportunityContactRole operations:
- **Validation**: Ensures contact roles have required fields
- **Opportunity Updates**: Updates opportunity descriptions with contact role counts
- **Change Detection**: Only processes updates when relevant fields change
- **Recursion Prevention**: Checks recursion limits before performing DML operations

## How Recursion Prevention Works

### Before the Solution:
```
Opportunity Update → OpportunityContactRole Insert → Opportunity Update → OpportunityContactRole Update → ...
(Infinite loop until Salesforce limit exceeded)
```

### After the Solution:
```
Opportunity Update → OpportunityContactRole Insert (depth=1) → 
Opportunity Update (depth=2) → OpportunityContactRole Update (depth=3) → 
Opportunity Update (BLOCKED - depth would exceed limit of 3)
```

### Key Prevention Mechanisms:

1. **Depth Tracking**: Each operation type tracks its recursion depth
2. **Early Exit**: Operations exit early when recursion limit would be exceeded
3. **Try/Finally Cleanup**: Ensures recursion counters are properly decremented
4. **Operation Isolation**: Different operation types (e.g., ContactRoleUpdate_FromOpportunity vs OpportunityUpdate_FromContactRole) have separate limits

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive test classes ensure the solution works correctly:

- **TriggerRecursionHelperTest**: Tests all recursion tracking functionality
- **OpportunityTriggerHandlerTest**: Tests opportunity business logic and validation
- **OpportunityContactRoleTriggerHandlerTest**: Tests contact role business logic and validation

All tests include:
- Positive scenarios (normal operation)
- Negative scenarios (validation failures)
- Recursion prevention scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Prevents Infinite Loops**: Stops trigger recursion before Salesforce limits are hit
2. **Maintains Functionality**: Business logic still works within safe recursion limits
3. **Debugging Support**: Detailed logging helps identify recursion scenarios
4. **Configurable Limits**: Recursion depth limits can be adjusted per operation type
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests ensure reliability
6. **Performance**: Minimal overhead from recursion checking

## Usage

The solution is transparent to end users. When deployed:

1. Triggers automatically use recursion prevention
2. Normal business operations continue to work
3. Recursive scenarios are safely handled
4. System logs provide visibility into recursion prevention actions

## Deployment

To deploy this solution:

1. Deploy all Apex classes and triggers
2. Run tests to verify functionality
3. Monitor debug logs for recursion prevention messages
4. Adjust recursion limits if needed based on business requirements

The solution follows Salesforce best practices for trigger patterns and provides a robust foundation for preventing trigger recursion issues.
